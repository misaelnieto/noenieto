  I want this code to be GPL v2, but I'm going to use the Uncomplicated theme,
  which has Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 and i don't know If it can be mixed
  with my code. So let the licence of this software to be in such a wayt that is
  both compatible with GPL V2 and Creative Commons Attribution 2.5. If that is not
  possible, then don't use this software. Or feel free to contact me and suggest a
  solution.
